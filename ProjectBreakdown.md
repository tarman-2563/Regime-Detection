Relationships : 
1️. USERS → DATASETS
Relationship: One-to-Many (1 : N)
One user can upload many datasets.
Each dataset belongs to one user.


2️. USERS → MODEL_RUNS
Relationship: One-to-Many (1 : N)
One user can train many models.
Each model run belongs to one user.


3️. DATASETS → MODEL_RUNS
Relationship: One-to-Many (1 : N)
One dataset can generate multiple model runs.
Each model run is based on one dataset.


4️. MODEL_RUNS → REGIME_PARAMETERS
Relationship: One-to-Many (1 : N)
One model run has multiple regimes.
Each regime has one mean and variance.
So one model → many regime parameter records.


5️. MODEL_RUNS → TRANSITIONS
Relationship: One-to-Many (1 : N)
One model run has multiple transition entries.
Each entry represents probability from regime i → regime j.


6️. MODEL_RUNS → REGIME_SEQUENCES
Relationship: One-to-Many (1 : N)
One model run produces many timestamp-regime mappings.
Each timestamp has one regime label.
